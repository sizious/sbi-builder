SBI Builder Wizard

Auteur   : [big_fury]SiZiOUS a.k.a SiZ!

I) Presentation : 
-----------------

Hello everyone! 

This program was build in order to create a SBI pack with a valid Dreamcast application, 
such an ELF or unscrambled/scrambled BIN file. SBI files are extensions for Selfboot Inducer.

You can use the lastest version (at this time), "Selfboot Inducer v4 Stage III : Ultimate Power",
available at my website : http://sbibuilder.shorturl.com/.

You can add a screenshot, a SBI comment, add extras files, etc.
For MAC Users, please check the box "MacDreamTool support", it add the SBI comment in a
file, called "<BINNAME>_comment.txt".

II) Use : 
---------

Very simple. You don't need a tutorial. If you want to learn more about it, please
visit the Fackue tutorial at :

"http://www.consolevision.com/members/fackue/tut_sbi.shtml".

III) Credits : 
--------------

This app was written by [big_fury]SiZiOUS (SiZ!). 
It's freeware and can be distributed, if you keep the original package.
Sorry for my very very baaaaaaaaad english, I'm THE worst in English :)

Thanks to you and burnerO for his Selfboot inducer ;)
